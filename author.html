            <h1>About</h1>
            <h1><span>The Artist</span></h1>
            <p>Hello I'm James Lewis, a multidisciplinary British artist.

                At the age of 16 I decided to improve my handwriting by taking up calligraphy as a hobby. The hobby quickly grew into a passion for the creative process, and I was hooked.</p>
                
                <p>Five years later, with a degree in graphic design, I set out to pursue my artistic practise full-time. Beginning my career as a commercial lettering artist, I slowly developed my creative style as I learned how to best produce entertaining, artistic video content. This enthusiasm for video content, social media understanding, and traditional artistic approach, have since formed the basis of my creative style.</p>
                
                 
                
                <p>I now share my artistic process with a global audience of over 5 million people, across Instagram and TikTok, with my videos collectively accumulating over 1 billion views. 
                
                 
                
                I exhibit my art, and teach workshops all over the world. Whilst working with some of the most well known brands on a range of creative projects, from video content creation and public speaking, to live mural painting, and product development.</p>>
                
                â€‹
                
                <p>Even with all the calligraphy practise, my  natural handwriting still needs improving.
                
                So, if you'd like to get in touch to discuss a project, 
                
                please contact me via email.</p>
